# Setup Guide

This guide is very minimal and contains steps to just get your server and client up and running.

## You'll need to patch the game to even enter the game world (see below).

## Read the handbook (found at the end of the file)

- Make sure to install java and set the environment variables.
- Build the server (refer to "Compile the actual server" in this guide.)
- Put [Astrolabe.dll](https://github.com/pmagixc/LunaGC_5.4.0/raw/main/patch/Astrolabe.dll) in the local game root directory
- Download the [Resources](https://github.com/pmagixc/5.4-res), make a new folder called `resources` in the downloaded LunaGC folder and then extract the resources in that new folder.
- Set useEncryption, Questing and useInRouting to false (it should be false by default, if not then change it)
- Start the server and the game, make sure to also create an account in the LunaGC console!
- Have fun

### Getting started

- Clone the repository (install [Git](https://git-scm.com) first )
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/pmagixc/LunaGC_5.4.0.git
  ```
  
- Now you can continue with the steps below.
  

### Compile the actual Server

**Requirements**:

[Java Development Kit 17 | JDK](https://oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or higher

- **Sidenote**: Handbook generation may fail on some systems. To disable handbook generation, append `-PskipHandbook=1` to the `gradlew jar` command.
  
- **For Windows**:
  
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat
  .\gradlew.bat jar
  ```
  
- **For Linux**:
  
  ```bash
  chmod +x gradlew
  ./gradlew
  ./gradlew jar
  ```

### You can find the output JAR in the project root folder.

### Manually compile the handbook

```shell
./gradlew generateHandbook
```

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure to set useEncryption and useInRouting both to false otherwise you might encounter errors.
- To use windy make sure that you put your luac files in C:\Windy (make the folder if it doesnt exist)
- If you get an error related to MongoDB connection timeout, check if the mongodb service is running. On windows: Press windows key and r then type `services.msc`, look for mongodb server and if it's not started then start it by right clicking on it and start. On linux, you can do `systemctl status mongod` to see if it's running, if it isn't then type `systemctl start mongod`. However, if you get error 14 on linux change the owner of the mongodb folder and the .sock file (`sudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /var/lib/mongodb` and `sudo chown mongodb:mongodb /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock` then try to start the service again.)

## How to make or get custom banners?

- Pre-made: [github repo](https://github.com/Zhaokugua/Grasscutter_Banners)
- Rename the file you chose to download to Banners.json and replace it with the already-existing one in the data folder.
- The repo also offers a file which contains all of the banners, to use it follow the same procedure mentioned above.
  
  ### Making custom banners
  
- If you want to make a custom banner for a character or weapon, you'll need to know the prefabPath, the titlePath and the character/item IDs.
- Fun fact: You can set any item to be on the rateUp, even if it's a 4* instead of a 5*.

  ### Make sure to not include <> or [] in the commands! The stuff in <> means its required and the stuff in [] means its not required.
  
  ### How to get all of the stuff maxed out: /g all lv90 r5 c6 c6 sl10 | Then do a separate one for the materials: /g mats x99999
  
  ### Ways to TP around the map:
  

Method 1:

- 1: Unlock the map: /prop um 1
- 2: Open the map
- 3: Use the waypoints

Method 2:

- 1: Open the map
- 2: Place a fishing rod marker (the last one) where you want to teleport and mark it.
  
  ### How to get avatar/entity/material etc. IDs?
  
- Go to [ambr.top](https://ambr.top)
- Search up the material/avatar/enemy and then the ID of it should be in the URL of the site, for example I searched for the pyro hilichurl archer; the link for it is ambr.top/en/archive/monster/21010501/pyro-hilichurl-shooter so the ID for it will be 21010501.

### How to spawn monsters?

- Get the ID from the ambr.top link (above)
- Do /spawn <id> in the in-game chat. You can also find out more arguments that you can use to modify the monster hp etc by doing `/help spawn` or `/spawn` | Example: `/spawn 21010501`, that will spawn a pyro hilichurl. Give it more hp: `/spawn 21010501 hp9999` and you can find more about the arguments trough the method I mentioned above.

### How to use the /uid command?

- Rich text is supported
- How to set custom UID: `/uid set changethistext` | bold: `/uid set <b>changethistext</b>` | italic: `/uid set <i>changethistext</i>` | combined: `/uid set <i><b>changethistext</b></i>` | colored text (you'll need a hex color code, you can easy get and pick one by search hex color picker on google now let's assume that you have done it): `/uid set <color=#698ae8>changethistext</color>`
- You can also include spaces like this: `/uid set <b>B O L D</b>`
- You can combine the bold, italic and colored text
- Restore to server-default UID: `/uid default`
