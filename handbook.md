## How to make or get custom banners?

- Pre-made: [github repo](https://github.com/Zhaokugua/Grasscutter_Banners)
- Rename the file you chose to download to Banners.json and replace it with the already-existing one in the data folder.
- The repo also offers a file which contains all of the banners, to use it follow the same procedure mentioned above.
  
  ### Making custom banners
  
- If you want to make a custom banner for a character or weapon, you'll need to know the prefabPath, the titlePath and the character/item IDs.
- Fun fact: You can set any item to be on the rateUp, even if it's a 4* instead of a 5*.

## How to get avatar/entity/material etc. IDs?
  
- Go to [gi.yotta.moe](https://gi.yatta.moe/en)
- Search up the material/avatar/enemy and then the ID of it should be in the URL of the site, for example I searched for the pyro hilichurl archer; the link for it is gi.yotta.moe/en/archive/monster/21010501/pyro-hilichurl-shooter so the ID for it will be 21010501.


## How to spawn monsters?

- Get the ID from the ambr.top link (above)
- Do /spawn <id> in the in-game chat. You can also find out more arguments that you can use to modify the monster hp etc by doing `/help spawn` or `/spawn` | Example: `/spawn 21010501`, that will spawn a pyro hilichurl. Give it more hp: `/spawn 21010501 hp9999` and you can find more about the arguments trough the method I mentioned above.

## How to use the /uid command?

- Rich text is supported
- How to set custom UID: `/uid set changethistext` | bold: `/uid set <b>changethistext</b>` | italic: `/uid set <i>changethistext</i>` | combined: `/uid set <i><b>changethistext</b></i>` | colored text (you'll need a hex color code, you can easy get and pick one by search hex color picker on google now let's assume that you have done it): `/uid set <color=#698ae8>changethistext</color>`
- You can also include spaces like this: `/uid set <b>B O L D</b>`
- You can combine the bold, italic and colored text
- Restore to server-default UID: `/uid default`
